# sortingOperatorsAnalysis
This is a software that I built for my bechelor degree thesis in computer science.
Its purpose is to help analyzing the behavior of a class of sorting operators 
  (e.g. bubblesort, stacksort, queuesort) with class patterns of whole numbers.

Note: this does not use sorting algorithms, but sorting operators, so for example,
  for the bubblesort algorithm we observe the operator B():
  bubblesort(x) = B(...B(B(x))...)
